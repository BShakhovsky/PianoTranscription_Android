# Description

Android app which plays audio files (and it can also extract audio-stream of some video formats).  Not only MIDI-files are supported, but also MP3, MP4, etc.  Polyphonic piano transcription feature will generate MIDI from audio/video.

No instrument information is extracted, and all transcribed notes get combined into one part.  The accuracy depends on the complexity of the song, and is obviously higher for solo piano pieces.  Currently, accuracy for piano pieces is around 75%.

Want to transcribe some piano piece from YouTube?  You can google for websites/apps that will download video from YouTube.  You then can open downloaded file in my application.

# About Midi/Karaoke Files

You can find plenty of them over the internet.  Those *.mid or *.kar files usually consist of several tracks, including percussion.  You probably would not want to play percussion-tracks on piano, because their "MIDI-notes" do not overload correctly on piano-notes.  So, in the most cases, you may choose any kind of tracks, but percussions (like "Drums", "Rhythms", "Hit", "Blow", "Strike", "Clash", etc.) will be disabled.

However, no instrument information is extracted, and all transcribed notes get combined into one part.  The accuracy depends on the complexity of the song, and is obviously higher for solo piano pieces.  Accuracy for piano pieces is around 75%.

3. If you opened an existing MIDI-file, select tracks.  Percussion-tracks (like “Drums”, “Rhythms”, “Hit”, “Blow”, “Strike”, “Clash”, etc.) will be disabled.
